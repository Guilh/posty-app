Coding lets me build ideas into tangible things. A blank editor becomes a tool, a product, or a tiny utility that saves someone time.

Here are a few reasons I enjoy it:

1. Creative Problem Solving – Turning vague requirements into something that works is deeply satisfying.
2. Instant Feedback – Run, test, iterate. The loop from idea to validation is fast.
3. Continuous Learning – There is always a new concept, paradigm, or pattern to explore.
4. Empowerment – With a laptop and time, you can create something globally accessible.
5. Community – Open source and shared knowledge accelerate everyone.

Ultimately, I like coding because it’s a craft: equal parts logic, empathy for users, and iterative refinement.
